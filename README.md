# Science-Fair-Website

[Check it out!](https://science-fair-website.npcool.repl.co)

I created this website as a dashboard for the smart irrigation controller I developed for Science Fair. I used flask as the backend for my webserver and used ajax and mongodb to create a responsive login and signup page.
All the stored data about the devices is stored in mongodb
